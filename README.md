## Project Overview
A Python portfolio calculator that reads sample reference prices from CSV and calculates estimated holding and portfolio values.

This repository is part of a practical CodeAlpha project collection. It demonstrates a focused workflow using Python and related tools.

## Why We Built This Project
Investors and learners need a clear way to organize holdings and calculate approximate value. This project demonstrates file handling and arithmetic using structured examples.

## Objectives
- Apply Python to a practical problem.
- Build an understandable workflow from input to output.
- Practice reusable programming and data-processing concepts.
- Present results in a clear format.
- Document assumptions and limitations.

## Key Features
- Read sample stock prices from CSV
- Enter symbols and quantities
- Calculate holding values
- Calculate total portfolio value

## How It Works
Read symbol-price pairs from CSV, accept quantities, look up sample prices, calculate holding values and sum the portfolio.

## Technologies Used
Python, CSV module, dictionaries, functions, input validation

## Who Can Benefit
- Python learners
- finance students
- beginner investors learning portfolio concepts.

## Benefits and Applications
- **Practical learning:** connects programming concepts with a real-world style use case.
- **Efficiency:** demonstrates how software can reduce repetitive manual work.
- **Clearer insights:** organizes data and outputs for easier review.
- **Extensibility:** provides a starting point for improved datasets, testing and interfaces.
- **Portfolio value:** demonstrates problem-solving and technical implementation skills.

## Project Structure
```text
python-stock-portfolio-tracker/
├── app.py
├── data/                 # Included where required
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Umair104DB/Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
   cd Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
   ```

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

   macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Run the Project
```bash
python app.py
```

Check the actual project entry-point filename before publishing. If it differs, update this command to match your source code.

## Example Usage
1. Start the application using the command above.
2. Provide the required input, file or sample record.
3. Run the operation, analysis or prediction.
4. Review the displayed output.
5. Try another input to compare results.

### Sample input
For data projects, inspect the CSV header and use values matching the expected columns and data types. For interactive projects, follow the prompts displayed by the application.

### Sample output
The result depends on the supplied input and current dataset or model. It may be a predicted class, extracted webpage elements, descriptive statistics, calculated portfolio value, game status or chatbot response. Add a real terminal capture or screenshot after testing.

## Dataset and Sample Data
If this repository includes CSV data, document its filename, columns, record count and source here. Clearly label synthetic records as synthetic. Keep replacement datasets consistent with the input columns and data types expected by the code.

## Limitations
Prices are static sample values unless a live provider is integrated. Not investment advice or live market data.

This repository is an educational project. Validate the implementation, data quality and outputs before using it in a real-world workflow.

## Future Improvements
- Add automated tests and stronger input validation.
- Improve error handling and logging.
- Use larger, representative and properly licensed datasets.
- Improve accessibility and interface design.
- Add reproducible deployment instructions.
- Compare alternative methods and document evaluation metrics.
